### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jerry and I'm a self-taught developer. I actually decided to learn how to code because I wanted to start my own startup company, but had a hard time finding technical co-founders. Eventually I just said screw it, I'll learn how to do it myself. It was probably one of the best decisions I've ever made in life so far. I love being able to think about an idea and build it myself, whether it's for personal automation or for my company.

I love custom mechanical keyboards! You can often find me building them over the weekend or working on adding new products to my mechanical keyboard store. If you love custom mechanical keyboards, give me a shout! I've already worked with some talented folks on custom cases and PCBs. If you're interested in designing mechanical switches, PCBs, cases, let me know :)

My goal is to help more people learn how to code through self learning instead of spending lots of money upfront. Feel free to reach out to me whenever you'd like. I can't promise that you'll get a response right away, but I always make an effort to respond to every email I receive.
